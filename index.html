      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have been living in Switzerland for four years and I am originally from Ukraine. I am currently a second-semester Data Science student at FHNW. Thanks to FHNWâ€™s Project Integral program, which provides university access for international students, I was able to start my education here and take the first steps toward my data-driven career goals. Throughout my studies, I have focused particularly on machine learning, sustainability, and applied digital innovation.</p>

      <p>By combining my academic background with practical field experience, I have developed a multidisciplinary perspective. I have been actively involved in environmental projects and technology-driven public outreach initiatives. These experiences have shown me the real-world impact that data science can have on ecological and societal challenges, and they have deepened my passion for this field. You can find more detailed information about my projects in the Projects section</a>.</p>
    
      <p>I speak English fluently (C1 level) and German at an advanced level (B2â€“C1). With strong communication skills, a collaborative mindset, and a structured approach to problem-solving, I work effectively both independently and within teams. I prioritize continuous learning and aim to apply my skills and experiences to create meaningful and sustainable solutions.</p>

    <h2>Reflection on the Data Science Internship Position</h2>
    <p>When I was exploring internship opportunities, the Data Science Internship at Kanadevia Inova immediately caught my eye. Unlike many other roles that focus only on technical tasks, this internship blends technology with sustainability â€” something I really care about. Their mission to turn waste into valuable resources feels meaningful to me, not just innovative. Iâ€™ve always believed that technology should be used to make the world a better place, and Kanadeviaâ€™s work reflects that. Thatâ€™s why, out of all the options I looked at, this one stood out as something that truly matters.</p>
    
    <p>I feel this position fits me especially well because of both my academic background and the experiences Iâ€™ve gathered along the way. Through my studies at FHNW and my own projects, Iâ€™ve built strong skills in Python, machine learning, and data visualization. Working on waste classification and building interactive dashboards taught me how powerful data can be when applied thoughtfully. I also really enjoy working in teams and sharing ideas, which is why I think I would fit well into Kanadeviaâ€™s research-focused environment. Itâ€™s not just about having the right skills â€” itâ€™s about sharing the same mindset and values.</p>
    
    <p>What excites me most is the opportunity to both contribute and keep growing. I hope to bring fresh energy, creative thinking, and solid technical skills to Kanadeviaâ€™s projects. At the same time, Iâ€™m looking forward to learning even more from a team thatâ€™s deeply committed to using data for good. I want to be part of something meaningful â€” helping to refine data methods, support sustainability efforts, and make a real impact. I see this internship not just as a next step, but as the right step toward building a career that combines data science, purpose, and innovation.</p>

    <h2>Reflection on the Skills Audit</h2>
    <p>Doing the Skills Audit was honestly a great reminder for me â€” a reminder of where Iâ€™m strong, but also where I can still grow. It highlighted communication, collaboration, and problem-solving as some of my strengths, and that felt accurate. I use those skills a lot in group projects, and I genuinely enjoy working with others to find solutions and share ideas.</p>
    
    <p>On the flip side, the audit pointed out that I could boost my numerical confidence and get better at tools like Excel. I definitely agree. Even though Iâ€™m comfortable with statistics, sometimes I could be quicker and more precise, especially when working with large datasets. Iâ€™ve already started working on this by doing more hands-on projects and taking short online courses. In the context of the Kanadevia internship, I donâ€™t see these as major disadvantages â€” I see them as growth areas. Iâ€™ll have plenty of opportunities to keep improving while contributing to real, meaningful projects.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the day, reflection for me isnâ€™t about focusing on weaknesses â€” itâ€™s about staying open, being honest with myself, and always moving forward. Iâ€™m excited to keep building my skills in these areas because I know theyâ€™ll make me a stronger data scientist. Growth is part of the journey, and Iâ€™m ready for it.</p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy activities that keep me balanced, energized, and connected. I practice martial arts, which helps me maintain both physical fitness and mental discipline. I am also passionate about learning new languages, as it allows me to better understand and appreciate different cultures.</p>

    <p>Spending quality time with people I care about is very important to me, and I enjoy meaningful conversations, shared experiences, and simply enjoying the moment together. These hobbies not only enrich my personal life but also strengthen my ability to work collaboratively and adaptively in diverse environments.</p>
